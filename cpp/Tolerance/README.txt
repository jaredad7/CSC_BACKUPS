The Tolerance Game models the effects of tolerant and intolerant people on society.
The rules of the game are mostly described in comment sections of the source code (in both source files).

Basically, people who are intolerant will reach a level of violence at which they will kill those who disagree with their point of view. At what point will society stabilize? Experiment by changing the values of constant variables before compilation! Later versions of the game will add varying levels of complexity to more accurately model human interactions.

To run the game, compile tolerance.cc. Be sure that tolerance.cc is in the same directory as person.h when you compile it. (You must have a C++ compiler in order to run this program. If you have a UNIX based operating system, the file included may run, but it would be best to compile a version specifically for your system).

The version associated with this file is version 1, created on 2/4/14.
