Thank you for downloading this first tutorial on C++.
There are 8 introductory-level lessons in this chapter, followd by two practice lessons and a programming challenge at the end.
Each lesson is a compilable source code file with extensive commenting to explain the nature of the code.
After reading the file, compile it to see what it does.
Try changing some code around and see if things change.

If you are runing a Windows PC, you will likely need to download a compiler for c++.
I recommend using one of these three IDE's (Integrated Development Environments):

http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads

If you are running a UNIX/LINUX machine, then you probably already know that your OS comes with some pretty nice default text editors.
If you have none, try installing: vim, vi, emacs, or gedit.
If you do not have the command g++ installed, you will need to learn how to install it on your particular OS.
If you want to use an IDE, there are UNIX/LINUX versions available for all three listed above.
If you using a Mac, it is running an OS based on UNIX.

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to email me about them at jaredad7.jd@gmail.com.

The lessons provided only scratch the surface of the c++ language with practical, pre-written examples of source code.
