Your challenge for this Chapter is to design a program with which a user can play Tic-Tac-Toe.
There should be an option to play against the computer or against another human.
The program should only accept proper input, and should loop until proper input is received.
The board should be displayed in "ASCII ART", as shown below:

| x | o | o |
|   | x |   |
|   | x | o |

**Hint: you should save the state of the board in an array or a vector.
**Hint: while loops and for loops are very useful, especially for programing games.

Good luck. This should be mildly challenging if you have been paying attention, and if you have completed the practice lessons.
Look back at lessons for examples, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you get stuck.
