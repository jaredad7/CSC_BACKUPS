Compile each of these source codes with g++
Remeber to use flag -lpthread when compiling those which contain pthreads.
Notice that the programs which do no call forked processes end after the exec call, even though they contain a while(1); infinite loop.
As pthread_example.cc shows, however, threads will not close their parents.
Forks will not close their parents either, but are used for exec functions because exec closes the process that called it.
The thread, while technically running in parallel, is seen as the same process as its parent by the OS, and therefore closes the whole program by calling exec functions.
