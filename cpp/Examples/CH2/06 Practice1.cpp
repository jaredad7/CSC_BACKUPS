 *A Queue is just a line. Things that go into the Queue are
 *sent to the back of the line, while the oldest thing in the
 *Queue is in the front.
 *
 *When we add something to a Queue, we Enqueue it. 
 *When we remove something, we Dequeue it.
 *
 *Write your own queue. It should enqueue, dequeue, and
 *be able to return its size. It should also be able to
 *store all sorts of data types.
 *
 *Don't forget to test your queue.
