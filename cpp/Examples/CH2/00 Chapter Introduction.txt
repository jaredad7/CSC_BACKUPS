This is Chapter 2 of the C++ beginner's tutorial by Jared Dembrun.
In this Chapter, we will learn about objects and object-oriented programming. We will also
talk about some data types.
Lessons will be done in much the same way as in Chapter 1.

Here we will discuss what a class is. A class is a device used in Computer Science to represent objects in
Object Oriented programming, but what is object oriented programming?

Object Oriented Programming, or OOP, is the abstraction of ideas into "objects", which allow us to use much
more powerful functions in order to make more complex programs. For example, a racing video game would have
many cars in it. Each of these cars is a distinct object, but they probably all share the same class (the car class).

So, now, when we have many distinct versions of the same object, we can represent them as instances of the same class.

You have already used classes in chapter 1. The vector is a class, and you create a vector object each time you make
a new vector. Strings are also objects in C++.

We will also learn about some types of data structures in this chapter, employing OOP to build our own.
