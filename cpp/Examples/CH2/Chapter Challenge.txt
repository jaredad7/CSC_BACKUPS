it should be quite simple for you to make a text-based adventure game.

You have the freedomm to do this however you wish, but you should strive
to meet the following requirements:

1) You should have at least eight locations.
2) Each location should have a few different actions which can be performed
3) Your main character needs to have an inventory with items and money
4) Your main character needs an amount of health
5) The game should take a new player at least five minutes to complete
