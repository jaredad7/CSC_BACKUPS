<p><br><br>The purpose of this website is to share artistic, philosophical, and scientific information which I have decided to share with the general public. A little information about me is contained below.</p>
<p>My name is Jared Dembrun. I am currently a student at Louisiana Tech University, studying <a href="http://coes.latech.edu/cyber-engineering/">Cyber Engineering</a> as well as <a href="http://coes.latech.edu/computer-science/">Computer Science</a>. My hobbies include Music (I play oboe, piano, clarinet, and guitar), programming (yes, it's a hobby as well), and philosophy. I am also a Roman Catholic, and I would love to answer any questions about my faith and what God has done for me. I plan to use this website to share my thoughts and ideas, as well as encourage thoughts and learning from everyone who visits. I see myself as both a student and a teacher. I find joy in helping others learn the things I already know, and sharing the knowledge of the things I enjoy with others is intrinsically rewarding.</p>
