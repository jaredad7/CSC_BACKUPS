what we need:
	ettercap
	wireshark
	
start ettercap to arp poison all nodes in the network so we can receive their traffic
this basically tells the network that we are identified as everyone else
when a node wants to send a message to another node, it asks who has the target IP (and to tell that node who has it)
this message is broadcasted to all nodes in the network
the node who has that IP responds with its MAC address (it's me!)
we are simply injecting messages in the network that says that we are all MAC addresses
the network, in its attempt to be redundant and robust, simply sends messages intended for a destination to everyone that claims it's that destination!
$ ettercap -Tq -i wlan3 -V hex -M arp:remote //

it attempts to scan all nodes in the network (some will show, some won't)
this ARP poisons everyone in the network (it's essentially a nice man-in-the-middle attack)
this will also allow us to start sniffing

in another terminal, we also run wireshark since it's a bit more user friendly and powerful
$ sudo wireshark

to quit ettercap, press q
