Cyberstorm: locking down the system
Use eth0 to get an ip address
One will likely automatically appear because of DHCP service.

VirtualBox component NAT:

Allows VM's to connect to one another.
We do not want to do this.
bridge adapter network (works for a VM as if an ethernet cable was plugged into it. Gives the VM a unique ip address).

How to allow access to VM's but not host?
Just shutdown eht0 (if this is the host)
$ ifconfig eth0 down 
#or
$ ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0 down (clear ip address and shutdown network access in host)

How to setup by Cyberstorm rules:
Only 10.x.x.x
ifconfig some VM internet
$ ifconfig eth0 10.1.13.14 netmask 255.255.0.0

subnet size (for netmask)
constant 255
dynamic 0

On debian:
edit /etc/network/interface to do these things automatically
On Redhat:
edit /etc/networking/somefiles to do these things automatically (Gourd doesn't remember)

Malware:

Virus: Self-replicating
Worm: Self-propagating (can get out through the network)
These two have sort of merged today. Virus has essentially become a subset of Worm.

Bacteria: Foreign entity that grows and eats memory (fork bomb)
Trojan: What the name implies, a trojan horse, or seemingly passive application with malicious behaviour.
Rootkit: Injects at a driver level, to alter driver codes.
Spyware: Sends information about what you do (keyloggers).
Adware: Advertises things (toolbar)
Spam: Unwanted mail
Phishing: Targeted spam

A machine set up specifically for vulnerabilities to attract hackers.
We can learn about hackers from these machines.
