Threat avoidance and Threat detection

IDS - Intrusion Detection System
IPS - Intrusion Prevention System
IDPS - Intrusion Dection&Prevention System

dection - detecting that someone has gotten into the system
prevention - limiting what a detected intruder can do on the system (like "gracefully degrading" a service)

Threat avoidance is more important than detection/prevention, as avoidance is the stopping of a threat all-together.
We can do this for specific kinds of attacks, but it is difficult(nearly impossible) to do this for all possible attacks across the board.

Threats we may be able to avoid:
Beaconing Malware (which would send out a quick burst of information to a hacker to get your ip etc.) Can solve using an Authentication switch.
At the SNIC, find out which process is running, and hash it as a process.
The switch contains a list of authorized processes which may send outbound packets.
It will respond with whether or not the process is authorized.
If it is not, SNIC drops the packets, and they never leave the system.
Authorization is only required for the outbound traffic.
LAN traffic is not checked.
Open ports (connect remotely) Solved with port knocking (in ssh)

Defense in Depth - Addding layers of security around the system.
Defense in Breadth -  Adding different kinds of securities for different kinds of attacks.

PDR^3 - Prevent(avoid) Detect Respond Recover Restore
Prevent
If I can't prevent, Detect and then respond
If responding fails (or is impossible), Recover
If damage is so bad that I can't recover, then, I can hopefully restore with a backup.
