Steganography: The hiding of something within something else (essentially)

Bitmaps and wav files are good for hiding things becuase they are large files. However, it will likely be extremely noticable

Things can be hidden in plain site with things like:

null ciphers (a certain letter in each word or every other word or any things at this level of simplicity represent the message)
microdot (hiding text in a small dot so you need a microscope to see it)
watermarking (both visible and invisible)

#########

Message vs. container:

The container must be (considerably) larger than the message (duh!)

JPG's, MP3's, and other compressed files, are much more difficult to use for steg.

#########

Replacing bytes with messages:
offset = be sure you skip the header
interval = distance between message components used to hide the message

#########

Replacing bits with messages:
Replace 8 bits over 8 bytes instead of whole bytes at a time.
If we replace the most insignificant bit, our senses will likely not catch the difference.
This will make the concealed message much less detectable

To get the bit in a certain position, shift right 7 and & the value with the value of 1.
b >> 7 & 1

To store the bit, and the container byte with all 1's and a zero in the last place (254?)
Then, or with message byte
c & 254 | b
 10110111 -container byte
&11111110
 10110110 -container byte with null last bit
|00000001
 10110111 -final byte containing message in least significant bit

To extract the original message, and container with 1, then shift left by 1
c &1 << 1
