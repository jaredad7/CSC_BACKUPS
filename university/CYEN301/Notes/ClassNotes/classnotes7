DHCP automates assigning ip addresses.
I can tell my router to give only ip's starting at 192.168.1.100 and only allow up to 50 connections.
Then, I can create static ip addresses below this value on the network.
We can beat MAC filtering (setting up your network to only allow certain mac addresses) can be beaten 
by going into promiscuous mode and sniffing packets for hardware addresses, then changing yours to match one
that is on the network.

Hiding SSID: a program called Kismet can find more information from your router if it is hidden because being
hidden forces more information to be sent between machines.
