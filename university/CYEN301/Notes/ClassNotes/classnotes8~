letter sub ciphers:
cryptograms - scramble letters "randomly"
alphabet shift cipher - shifts like ROT13
sliding shift cipher - encrypt each letter in the set {0,1,2...,n} with a shift corresponding to its location in the set

vigenere cipher:
sliding shift adding a key

If message is HELLO WORLD and key is BAD and slide is:
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
BCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZA
CDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZAB
DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC

HELLO WORLD message
BADBA DBADB key
IEOMO ZPROE

Go to key line, choose encrypted letter, go up to A line, choose original value
MATHEMATICALLY:
Ci = (Pi+Ki)%26 if in array
For ascii representation:
Ci=(Pi-65+Ki-65)%26+65
Pi=abs{(Ci-Ki)%26} || Pi=(26+Ci-Ki)%26

Timelock:
Needs a t=0 (epoch time)
Needs a current time (syncronized between the two machnies)

1) Calculate time elapsed in seconds since some epoch time
2) Calculate MD5(MD5(e)) where e=time elapsed (current time - epoch time)
3) Extract [A-Fa-f]{2} left-to-right followed by [0-9]{2} right-to-left

Some MD5 Hash: 03AGFDERYTE&@(#%&&@(83470147381389A
Go right: get first A-Fa-f = AF
Go left: get first 0-9 = 98
