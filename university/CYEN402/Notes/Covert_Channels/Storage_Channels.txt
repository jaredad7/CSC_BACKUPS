We have headers in Network packets
IP and TCP headers

3rd field in IP header is Type of Service 4500 (ipversion, 5*4=20 bytes size, 00 is type of service)
This field is now rarely used, and usually defaults to 0.

Ip Identification is 16 bits. Used for reassembly of fragments.
If packets are not going to be fragmented, this field can be used as a channel.

Ip Fragment Offset is 14 bits. 
If fragmentation is not an issue, this field can be used as a channel.

Ip Flags use 2 bits.
Tells if we will fragment.
