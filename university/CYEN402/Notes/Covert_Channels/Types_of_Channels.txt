Objectives:
Identification of Convert Channels
Determination of Covert Channel Bandwidth
Handling Covert Channels, Policies, and Procedures

Definitions:
Covert Channels are those that use entities not normally viewed as data objects to transfer information from one subject to another.
Storage Channels involve direct or indirect writing of a storage location, as well as direct or indirect reading from the location.
Timing Channels involves signaling information by modulating its own system resources, which affects real response time observed by second process.

Noisy vs Noiseless:
A channel is noiseless if the symbols transmitted by the sender are the same as the symbols received by the reciepient.
A channel is noisy if this is not the case.
Noise helps to determine bandwidth.
