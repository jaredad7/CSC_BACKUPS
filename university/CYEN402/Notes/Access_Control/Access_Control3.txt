Access Control Methods:
-Access Control Matrices (Of course, in large systems, matrices will be large)
-Access Control Lists (The column of the matrix)
-Capabilities Lists (Rows of the matrix)

List Advantages:
The object has its own list of users who can access.
It is easy to determine access to an object.
Access to an object is easy to revoke.

List Disadvantages:
Difficult to tell what kinds of access a particular user may have
Difficult to revoke a user's rights to all objects

Capabilities List Advantages:
The list contains the access rights of all users.
Easy to tell what kinds of access a particular user may have
Easy to revoke a user's rights to all objects

Capabilities List Disadvantages:
It is difficult to determine access to an object.
Access to an object is difficult to revoke.

Design Principles; produce a system that can prevent all attacks:

1) Economy of Mechanism - keeping the system as simple as practically possible
2) Fail-safe Defaults - basing access decisions on permission
3) Complete Mediation - a user's authority must be checked whenever access is attempted
4) Open Design - design should not be secret
5) Separation of Privileges - require two keys to unlock something
6) Least Privilege - providing the least amount of privilege necessary to complete the task
7) Least Common Mechanism - minimize dependence or access on common resources
8) Psychological Acceptability - give user peace of mind via security interface
