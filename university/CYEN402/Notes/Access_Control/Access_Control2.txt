Access Control is the heart of security. 
We need the ability to allow only authorized entities (users, programs, processes, etc) to access resources.

Policy Models: Configuration and Management
DAC-Discretionary Access Control
	An individual user can set an access control mechanism to allow or deny access to an object.
	Relies on owner to control access.
	Strengths: Flexibility
	Weaknesses: Control is done in broad rules, no fine control
	Key Concepts: File and Data Ownership; Access Rights
MAC-Mandatory Access Control
	A system-wide policy decrees who is allowed to access; individuals cannot alter that access.
	Relies on system to control access.
