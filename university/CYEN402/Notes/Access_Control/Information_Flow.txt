Information Flow is some policy designed to preserve confidentiality and/or integrity of our data.
Prevent the flow of information to those not authorized to receive it.

Multi-Level Security:
Want to allow information to reach those with authorization to read it
Allow information flows between users that have sufficient security clearance
Prevent flows to those that do not have sufficient clearance
If we can identify all possible flows, then these policies can be implemented to preserve security
If we can't identify a possible flow, then there is the potential that information will flow to an unauthorized user.

Some information flow channels:
Overt Channels - Channels over which a user is authorized to communicate
Covert Channels - Channels over which a user is unauthorized to communicate (violates a policy)
