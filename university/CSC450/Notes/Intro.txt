Local Area Networks (LAN)
-Lower Cost
-Short Distance = faster links, lower latency
-One Management Domain
-More Homogenous
Examples are: Ethernet, Token Ring, FDDI, 802.11 wireless

Multiplexing (A selected broadcast)
-Need to share network resources. How? Using a switched network
	-Party A gets resources sometimes
	-Party B gets resources sometimes
-Interior nodes act as switches

Circuit Switching
-Source first establishes a connection
	-Each switch along the way stores information about the connection
-Source sends the data over the circuit
-Connection is explicitly torn down
Pros: Fast and predicatable
Cons: Lots of users with "bursty" traffic, differing bandwith needs

Packet Switching: built on Circuit switching
-Source sends information as self contained packets with an address and may have to break up the full message
-Each packet travels independently to the destination host
-Very efficient and general. Accomadtes "bursty" traffic. Store and forward.

Congestion and Delays
-Keep in mind: Efficiency, Reliability, Management, Security, and Scalability
-Ease of creation and deployment is also important

Challenges of Networks
-Geographic scope (Internet vs LAN)
-Scale (Internet vs Home Network)
-Application Types (Email vs Video Conferencing)
-Trust and Administration (Corporate network-one network provider)

Internet
-An internet is a network of networks, while the Internet is the set of inconnected networks of the ISPs

Heterogeneity
-Address Formats
-Performance
-Packet Size
-Loss rate/handling
-Routing
-Diverse network technologies, as in ways to link

Internet Challenges
-Scale
	100,000,000s of hosts
	17,000+ ISPs, with new applicants each day
-Adversarial environment

Internet Design
-In order to inter-operate, all participating networks have to follow a common set of rules, for example, packet format
-Naming and routing nodes is important
-A DNS server converts URL addresses to ip address
-Routers are sensitive to bandwidth, and will route accordding to congestion.

Network Service Model
-Packets can get lost
-A good network is sensitive to QoS (Quality of Service)
-Reliability issues such as corruption and lost packets must be accounted for
-Congestion Control
-Fragmentation
-In-order Delivery

Fitting Data
-Max packet size is 1.5 KB
-Solution? Fragment data across packets, and label with sequence number

Networks implement many functions
-Link
-Multiplex
-Routing
-Addressing/naming
-Reliablity
-Flow Control
-Fragmentation

Metting Application Demands
-Sometimes interior if the network can do it
-Also could be on the host end
