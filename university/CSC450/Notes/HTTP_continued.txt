Server and CLient communicate over a network via a socket API.
A socket is an intermediate interface for network ports, which would exist between the TCP/IP and Application layers.

HTTP caching and proxies:
Enabling content reuse

Web Caching:
The purpose of caching is to store some amount of information to speed up connnections.
Users often revisit webpages. THere is a big save in overhead from reusing a local copy.
-Determining relevance:
-Locally determine that the copy is still valid.
-Base this on expiry information.
-Could also use a heuristic approach to guess.
-Content is then available much more quickly.
Revalidating:
-We need to revalidate with the server.
-Based on timestamp of copy.
-Or, could be based on content of copy.
-Content is then available after about 1 RTT (Request Transmit Time)

Web Proxies:
Place intermediary between pool of clients and external web servers:
-Benefits for clients include greater caching and security checking
-Organizational access policies are also provided
Proxy Caching:
-Clients Benefit from larger, shared cache
-Benefits limited by secure or dynamic content, as well as "long tail"
How it works:
-Client contacts proxy, which then contacts server
-The proxy will hold a cache for all clients on the network

A webpagetest can tell us where large overheads exist in loading a webpage.

Recent work to reduce PLT:
-Better use of the network
-Better content structures
-Giving modified version of page based on device

HTTP improvements:
-Multiplexed HTTP requests on one TCP connection
-Client priorities
-Others

Observation:
-The way pages are written affects how quickly they load

Apache will use the mod_pagespeed extension to re-write pages "on the fly"
