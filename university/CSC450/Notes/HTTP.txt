Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
Sir Tim Berners Lee (1955-) was the inventor of the "web," an internet application.
A Page can be viewed as a set of HTTP transactions (request and response).

Fetching a webpage:
1) Resolve the ip (DNS)
2) Set up TCP connection to server
3) Send HTTP request for the page and await response
4) Render page
5) Clean up idle TCP connections

Static vs Dynamic webpage.
Static page does not change.
Dynamic page runs php or javascript or executes some other program.

HTTP Evolution:
0.9 - very early
1.0 - developed, uses cookies
1.1 - persistent connections
2.0 - SPDY attempts better security

Originally a very simple protocol with many additional options over time

There are some codes like 403 or 404, which communicate different things to the client.
There are multiple headers for HTTP as well.

Performance:
Page Load Time (PLT) is the key measure of web performance. It is measured from the time the user clicks untill he sees the full page.
Network response time and bandwidth are also important.

Early Performance:
HTTP/1.0 uses one TCP connection to fetch one web resource.
This made HTTP very easy to build, but gave poor PLT.

Ways to decrease PLT:
1) Reduce content size
2) Change HTTP to utilize bandwidth more effectively
3) Change HTTP to avoid repeated transfers
4) Move content closer to client

Simple way to reduce PLT:
Browser can run multiple connections in parallel.
Persistent connections can be used so that there is no overhead in connection time.
Pipelining requests can also increase effeciency.
